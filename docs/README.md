### Feature adding tasks

When it comes to adding tasks (AKA some froggies:frog:), we have 3 different types of tasks for you to choose from:
1. Todo tasks
2. Deadline tasks
3. Events

Since they serve different purposes, they have different requirements. Let's go through them:
#### Adding a todo task to the list:
Simply type `todo <description>`
eg: todo email prof

#### Adding a deadline task to the list:
Type `deadline <description> /by <date> <end-time>`
eg: deadline finish assignment 1 /by 26/02/2022 2359

#### Adding an event task to the list:
Type `event <description> /at <date> <start-time> - <end-time>`
